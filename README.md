## 🔍 Project Title:  
**Audio-Based Secret Messaging App**  
*Transmit encrypted messages via sound — no Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or data needed.*

---

## 🕵️ Use Case / Why It’s Cool
Imagine two phones sitting next to each other — one sends a secret message **through high-frequency sound (inaudible to humans)**, and the other decodes it through its microphone.  
It’s like **data transfer via sound waves**, useful for:
- Offline data exchange
- Spy tools or fun secret chat
- Device pairing without network
- Classroom/study use for sneaky text transfer 😍

---

## 📱 Features Explained

### 🔊 1. Data-over-Sound Encoding (18kHz–22kHz)
- Converts text into data packets.
- Modulates data as audio tones in the **ultrasonic range** (above normal human hearing).
- Sends tones through the phone speaker.

> Example: 'HELLO' → binary → mapped to tones like 18000Hz, 18100Hz... etc.

### 🎧 2. Microphone/Speaker Handshake
- Before data transfer, devices do a quick **tone handshake** to sync.
- Could use a “ping” tone (like radar) to let the receiver know to start recording.

### 💧 3. Optional Audio Watermarking
- Embed watermark/fingerprint into sound for authenticity.
- Could also help in **error detection** or **app branding**.

### ↺ 4. Cross-Device (Web/Mobile)
- Should work between:
  - Android ↔️ Android
  - Android ↔️ Browser (via Web Audio API)
  - Browser ↔️ Browser
- Web app uses **Web Audio API** for both generating and analyzing ultrasonic sound.

## 🧠 Tech Stack Details

### 🔧 Frontend / Sender
- **Android (Java/Kotlin)** or **Web (JS)**
- Converts message to binary
- Maps binary → tone frequencies (FSK, ASK, or custom modulation)
- Plays modulated sound via speaker

### 🎧 Receiver
- Listens using microphone
- Uses FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to detect tone frequency
- Maps back from tone → binary → text

### 🔐 Encryption
- Optional **AES-128/256** or **custom lightweight cipher**
- Protects messages from being sniffed (e.g., if another mic is listening)

### 🧬 Error Correction
- **Reed-Solomon ECC** helps fix errors caused by noise
- Useful because ultrasonic waves can be affected by environment (walls, movement, etc.)

## 📊 Modulation Methods (Simple Example)

| Bit | Frequency |
|-----|-----------|
| 0   | 18000 Hz  |
| 1   | 19000 Hz  |
| Sync | 20000 Hz  |

- Each bit is played as a tone for a fixed duration (e.g., 50ms)
- Add **start/stop tones** to define boundaries

---

## 🧪 Challenges to Tackle

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Ambient noise | Use error correction (Reed-Solomon) |
| Devices have different speaker/mic quality | Dynamic calibration via handshake |
| Echo/overlap | Add delay between packets or unique “start tone” |
| Sound reflections in room | Use filtering and signal smoothing |

---

## 🚀 Extra Features (Future Scope)
- 📷 Use QR codes to pair devices before sending (for added security)
- 📜 Chat history encryption + storage
- 🌍 Add a local-only offline chat history
- 📡 Add option to "broadcast" message to nearby phones
- 🧑‍🏫 Educational Mode: visualize the signal as a waveform

---

## ✅ Sample Use Flow

### 🔐 Send Message:
1. Type your message
2. App encrypts + encodes it to audio
3. Plays high-frequency sound

### 🧠 Receive Message:
1. Opens mic in receive mode
2. Listens for handshake tone
3. Decodes sound to bits → text
4. Decrypts and shows the message

## 🌟 Final Thoughts

This is **perfect for GitHub** because:
- It involves **signal processing**, **encryption**, **low-level audio**, and **cross-platform logic**
- Super **unique**, not many public repos like this
- You can write **detailed documentation** with visuals, diagrams, and live demos
